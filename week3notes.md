## Summary:
The Political Coase Theorem (PCT) states that if property rights are well-defined and there are no transaction costs, agents will contract to achieve an efficient outcome. This contrasts with theories of belief differences, where leaders disagree on correct policies. A third approach, theories of social conflict, argues that decisions are driven by interest groups maximizing their own payoffs rather than social welfare. 

The enforceability of contracts underlies the Coase Theorem, typically upheld by the state. However, in the political context, those controlling the state can alter contract terms or renege on promises, leading to commitment problems that prevent efficient outcomes. To refute PCT, we must find societies choosing a policy regime worse than a more optimal alternative given their circumstances. To refute belief difference models, we must identify societies implementing policies that could never maximize social welfare. Social conflict theories act as a residual category, but they are valuable if they can pinpoint key transaction costs limiting PCT and identify variables influencing equilibrium policy inefficiency. The model concludes that a ruler with a longer time horizon tends to lead to more efficient equilibria.

## Questions:
- What theory of institutional change does this imply? If social conflict theories are correct and institutional differences significantly impact economic outcomes, we must determine how to transition to more efficient institutions. Look into Acemoglu and Robinson on this.
- What is the relevance of analyzing only stationary equilibria? 
- What should I review to better understand methods for finding the Nash solution?
- In the model, as instability (\(q\)) increases, the ruler makes more front-loaded decisions, but this effect is counteracted by citizens' reluctance to make front-loaded payments. I don’t fully understand this dynamic.

## Interesting Notes:
- **Becker and Mulligan (1998):** If redistribution is endogenous, politicians may use inefficient methods to minimize total redistribution. This aligns with Suzanne Mettler’s research and the pre- vs. post-redistribution debate.
- I've always been curious about the differential in aid/investment flows from **USSR → DPRK** vs. **USA → ROK**. Something to investigate, though it likely doesn’t fully explain the divergence.

## Summary:
Regional differentiation plays a key role in the relationship between land inequality and tenancy rates, which cannot be fully explained by information and market structure differences. The paper models the joint determination of agricultural economic organization and the political equilibrium of property rights distribution, focusing on **"to the tiller"** land reforms.

In some cases, landlords suppress tenancy in anticipation of future property rights challenges by tenants or squatters, leading to inefficiencies. In other cases, anticipated challenges to property rights can stimulate land sales markets. Empirically, in India, **land Gini** does not significantly affect reform indices, but a larger landless population increases both demand for and implementation of tenancy.

## Questions:
- Why focus on land transfers to current occupiers? What does this control for?
- I don’t fully understand the assumption that farm production is conducted only by households possessing some essential non-traded asset, and that an efficient equilibrium aligns operational farm sizes with household holdings of this asset.
- What are the implications of land reform often being unexpected in many countries, with landlords already effectively possessing redistributed land?
