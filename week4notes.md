## Summary:
The paper examines the spread of Protestant ideas through a dataset of 295,000 publications - using printer deaths as an exogenous shcok to competition. The authors find that increased competition led to greater diffusion of religious ideas, which in turn influenced long-term institutional change. The death of a printer led to increased competition, lower book prices, and increased publicaton volume. 

## Questions:
- While the study controls for prior media activity, market rights, type of rule, river access, university presence-etc, there may still be oother unobserved city-level economic or political strategies that influnece printer competition. What could these be?
- Was supply or latent demand driving the increase in Protestant printing?
- Could printer deaths be endogenous to economic distress leading to market exits?
- Could the results be driven by political fragmentation specific to Germany?

## Summary:
Patents have not always been essential for innovation, as many significant innovations have occurred outside the patent system. The author presents data from world fairs as evidence. Overly broad patents raise litigation risks and reduce knowlsge diffusion, and comulsory liscenscing may have increased innovation. Inventors and firms have alternatives to the patent system that they may turn to - secrecy and patent pools, if the patent system is too strict or not strict enough. Strong patent laws seem to shift the direction of innovation rather than increase its level. Copyirghts are likely better alternatives as they are narrower. 

## Questions:
- How applicable are findings from the 19th Century to contemporary intellectual property regimes?
- Were prize winning inventions at world fairs a sufficient proxy for high-quality innovation?

# Squicciarini and Voigtlander
## Summary:
The authors use subscriptions to the Encyclopedie in mid-18th century France as a proxy for knowledge elites. Cities with a high density of subscribers grew more significantly. Literacy levels wre correlated with the development in the cross-section but did not predict long-run growth. Income, soldier height, industrial output, etc. show a similar pattern. The mechanism is upper-tail human capital productivity gains. 

## Questions:
- I am super skeptical of this variable. Could the Encyclopedie subscriptions reflect differences in local wealth, instutitions, - or especially: the presence of commercially-oriented aristocrats and burghers for whom owning the Encyclopedie was a status symbol.
- Where are the guilds? Not controlled for even as the atuhors control for early printing presses and universities.

# Jones and Summers

## Summary:
The authors develop a method for estimating the social returns to innovation, accounting for spillover. The traditional measures of private returns understate benefits of innovation due to positive externalities. They estime direct spillovers, health ebenfits, and international spillovers, but account for delays in diffusion, capital deepening, and measurement biases. Argues that the marginal benefit of innovation is high. 
## Questions:
- The discount rate r is a key parameter for estimating social returns, how sensative are results to different r?
- What if growth comes from capital deepening?
- How can heterogeneity in spillovers refine policy decisions?

## Summary:
The paper develops a model to compare the advantages or disadvantages of private sector and academic research. The authors emphasize creative control vs. focus as tradeoffs rather than intellectual property concerns. Academis is a precommitment mechanism, reducing efficiency but reducing wage costs. Stronger IP protections can limit innovation, especially for early stage research. 

## Questions: 
- Field specific factors? 
- How does this interact with recent research on job satisfaction among researchers re. ai?
- Generically: why is our science policy not informed by any of this?
