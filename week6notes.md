## Summary:
This paper uses the exogenous effect of drought to study the effects of 
political insurgency, which is strongly associate with idiosyncratic
rainfall shocks. Areas with revolutionary insurgency had 22% more
surface area redistributed by land reform. These areas are also poorer and 
more agricultural, with less political competition. Ejidos were not private
plots - and could thus not be sold, developed etc. Land reform is the most 
plausible mechanism.

## Questions:
---
- Dell shows that droughts outside of the 1906-1910 period did not have
long-run effects, but how robust is this assumption?
- Could drought have driven land reform independent of insurgency?
- The mita paper controls for indigenous group status, why does Dell not 
do this here?
- It seems to me that path-dependence is a policy choice. The character
of the ejido system is the mechanism for persistence, rather than some 
effect independent of policy regimes. I would like to see research in other
instances of insurgent-driven land reform in which the new land regime
was more efficient.

## Summary:
- This paper details the economic history of the persistence of the 
QWERTY keyboard even when faced with better alternatives. QWERTY became
locked in by technical interrelatedness, economies of scale, and 
quasi-irreversibility.

## Questions:
- I recall David Friedman, paraphrasing the "Fable of the Keys", claiming that this
QWERTY/Dvorak story is a myth. There was no significant speed advantage
from Dvorak's keyboard, and tests claiming such an advantage were run by Dvorak
himself. Regardless, I think that all three explanations in this paper remain
plausible - there was a minor advantage to using Dvorak but economies of scale 
etc. were enough that shifting would be inefficient. 
- Fridges in supermarkets have a similar problem. I think in many cases like 
this, were path dependence is plausibly inefficient but costs to transition are
too high - are best solved (should they be desirable to "solve") by reducing 
costs to transition via subsidy etc. 
- Why has this story become so popular/endemic/culturally significant in 
economics? I feel like I see it everywhere.

## Summary:
This paper demonstrates that individual ownership may strengthen producitvity 
of land uses executed on small spaces, such as agriculture, but reduce 
productivity of large-scale activity. The researchers compare oil production
per acre on an Indian reservation and estimate the effects on production
by parcel size and ownership type, as well as fragmentation of the surrounding
land. 
## Questions:
- This paper is very credibly able to argue that its instrumental variable
is exogenous to shale endowments because the allotments precede the technology
to exploit or discover shale. How can I find similar, unambiguous relationships
in my own work?
- Why no Coase? - It's because transaction costs > 0, with costs of contracting
produced by the regulatory regime and ownership rights, as well as the character
of neighbors in fractured plots, etc. What policy regimes would encourage an
efficient solution through contract, beyond "solving" the fragmentation itself?
